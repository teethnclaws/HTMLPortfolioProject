		<h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
			<p>I have a confession to make. I'm a technophobe. Yeah, I do mean phobe. I've not someone many considered to be terribly tech savvy, or more like computers didn't seem to get along with me so I just didn't make much of an effort to get along with them.</p>
		
			<p>Then I decided it was time to get over my fears and actually try learning more about them. I use a computer everyday, but I never really used all of the tools available to me beyond the Office Suite and the internet.</p>
		
			<p>Then last year, after a little trial and error trying to figure out where to get started, <em>because WOW there are a lot of resources out there</em>, I began tinkering mostly with Front-End Web Development. I started with code-along-tutorials online, Code School, and Free Code Camp, and followed a few key people on YouTube and tech-related Podcasts.</p>
				
			<p>Now I'm attempting to make a more serious commitment towards coding more regularly in hopes that I can further hone my skillset in coding, and perhaps get an actual job in tech. So I joined the #301daysofcode and #100daysofcode groups on Twitter. In the last 6 months, I've networked rather successfully with other individuals like myself who are learning about tech. And I've accumulated hundreds of awesome resources and educational tools.</p>
				
			<p>Now I'm just taking it one day at a time, filling in the gaps or furthering my understanding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm currently trying to experiment with Git and Github, as I've not really worked much in version control. I am hoping to eventually get around to preprocessors like Sass, or frameworks like Bootstrap. And I'm considering learning WP and PHP, as WP is an extremely popular content management system.</p>
		
			<p>I'm currently learning various skills using courseware offered by Code School, EdX, Udemy, Skillcrush, Codecademy, and Free Code Camp.</p>

		<h3>My Skills</h3>
			<p>Again, as I mentioned I have been primarily focused with Front-End Development. This area of coding requires an understanding and application of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as how to use various tools like preprocessors and libraries. For me, ideally I want to have a pretty thorough understanding of one language before I dive too deep into another. At the moment I am working through the following languages:</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li>HTML</li>
					<li>CSS</li>
					<li>Javascript</li>
				</ul>
