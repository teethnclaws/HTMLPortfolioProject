		<h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
			<p>I have a confession to make. I'm a technophobe. Yeah, I do mean phobe. I've not someone many considered to be terribly tech savvy in the past or more like computers didn't seem to get along with me so I just didn't make much of an effort to get along with them.</p>
			<p>Then I decided it was time to get over my fears and actually try learning more about them. I use a computer everyday, but I never really used all of the tools available to me beyond the Office Suite and the internet.</p>
			<p>Then last year, after a little trial and error trying to figure out where to get started, I began tinkering mostly with Front-End Web Development. I began mostly with code-along-tutorials online, Code School, and Free Code Camp. Then I started following a few key people on YouTube and tech-related Podcasts.
				
			More recently, I'm attempting to make a more serious commitment towards coding more regularly in hopes that I can further hone my skillset in coding and perhaps get an actual job in tech.
